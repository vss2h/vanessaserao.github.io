<h3>1. Introduction</h4>
<h4>1.1 Overview</h4>
<p>
    SQPComparison application is a data structures comparison prototype focusing on Stack (S), Queue (Q) and Priority Queue (P). The “dummy application” which has only stack implemented, is a hands on tutorial on the three main method used in a Stack.

<h4>1.2 Goals and Objectives</h4>
<p>
    The main objective of this project is to demystify data structures to new developers and/or computer scientists and allow them to grasp those concepts in a less stressful environment. The SQPComparison application is expected to:  
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Introduce the user to different data structures</li>  
    <li>Guide the user through certain data structures’ methods </li>
    <li>Demonstrate the different behavior each function has when applied </li>
    <li>Compare the methods among similar data structures </li>
    <li>Entertain while teaching the user in a safe environment</li>  
  
</ol>

<h3>2. General Design and Environment</h4>
<h4>2.1 SQPComparison Application Environment </h4>
<p>The SQPComparison is a mobile app designed to work on an Android platform.  This application was built using the Android Studio Integrated Development Environment (IDE) as well as XML and Java.</p>
<h4>2.2 User Characteristics</h4>
<P><strong>SQPComparison Users:</strong> Any Android smartphone and tablet owner. </P>
<h3>3 Content and Capabilities </h4>
    <h4>3.1 Application Features</h4>
    <p>The application is composed of: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Three buttons including: </li>
        <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
            <li>A push button that activates the push method: Inserting the values into the stack </li>
            <li>A pop button to remove the last value entered in the stack or the current top value</li>
            <li>A top button keeping track of the most recent value in the stack.</li>
        </ul>

        <li>Four additional buttons that represent the different values to be entered in the stack. </li>
        <li>
            A soundtrack that plays at the end of the tutorial congratulating the user for his success in understanding the specific data structure.
        </li>
        <li>
            A guide at the top of the page walking the user through each step of the tutorial.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>3.2 Functionality and Code Snippets</h4>
    <p><strong>3.2.1 Button press and Event handler </strong></p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disk">
        <li> <strong>the PUSH button</strong> </li>
        <p>In the beginning of the tutorial, the guide prompts the user to press the PUSH button in order to get started. The push button in this case represent one of the 
            methods push() used often in a stack. When pressed, the push button will then activate the four words buttons that will serve as example for each methods. </p>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="column">
                    <img src= "app2.png"alt="Application Image 2" class="center" style="width:38%">
                </div>
                <div class="column">
                    <img src= "push.png"alt="Application Image 3" class="center" style="width:38%">
                </div>
            </div>   
            <p>As you can see above, the dialog changes when the push button is pressed. The functionality is implemented in MainActivity.java. When the push button is pressed, the four words buttons become visible to the user and the dialog gets updated to a new string, guiding the user to the next step of the tutorial. </p>
            <img src= "codeApp1.png"alt="Application Image 4" class="center" style="width:20%">   
            </p>
            </div>

            <li> <strong>the word buttons</strong> </li>
            <p>
                The word buttons are buttons holding the words to be used throughout the tutorial. When pressed, each button disappears, converts to a word and populate one at a time the stack until full. 
            </p>
            <img src= "word1.png"alt="Application Image 5" class="center" style="width:20%">
    
            <p>
                At every button press, the dialog provides the user with feedbacks and guides him to the following step. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Once the last word is pushed to the stack, the user gets notified that the stack is full, and it is time to move to the next step. 
            </p>
            <img src= "lastWord.png"alt="Application Image 6" class="center" style="width:20%">
            
            <li> <strong>the POP button</strong> </li>
            <p>
                When the user has pushed all the elements into the stack, the guide is ready to introduce the user to another method called pop. The pop method removes the most recently added element that has not yet been removed.  
            </p>
            <p>
                In this prototype, the user will only be able to remove the latest element entered in the stack. This is subject to be changed further in development and other data structures will be used to implement the functions properly.
            </p>
            <img src= "C:\users\owner\Desktop\Java\po.png"alt="Application Image 7" class="center" style="width:20%">
            
            <li> <strong>the TOP button</strong> </li>
            <p>
                As elements are always added to the top of a stack, top returns the most recently added element that has not been removed. It behaves like pop without deleting the element. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Since the top button is the last element before the end of the tutorial. It is implied that the user has successfully achieved the tutorial and has a good understand of stack and its methods.
            </p>
            <p>
                On button press, the function returns the top element in the stack.  The guide gives its last feedback on the functionality of the method, then congratulates the user for the good work.
            </p>
            <p>Furthermore, a sound plays in the background cheering and applauding the user’s success. </p>
            <p>The screens below are the resulting app after the top button was pressed. On the left is the guide giving the last feedback and on the right is the congratulation message after the 6 seconds have passed.</p>
