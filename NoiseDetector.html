     <h3>Noise Detector</h3>

     <h4> Overview</h4>
     <p>
         The noise detector is a project created for Middle Tennessee States University monitoring sound in the quiet zones of its library.
     <br>
        Its purpose is monitoring the sound in the quiet zones.<br>
        As the staff at the library were getting many complaints about the quiet zones being noisy at times, a tool was needed
        to come in help of those students.
