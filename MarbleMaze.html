    <h3>3D printed Marble Machine</h3>

    <h4>Introduction and Process</h4>
    <p>
        The 3d printed marble maze is a project made for a Biology class assignment. 
        <br>
        The requirement for this assignement was creating a marble machine that would be at least five-feet tall, keep a marble in motion for 
        8 seconds to a minute, be under $10. The assignment allowed students to be creative.
    </p>
    <p>
        Not having much biological knowledge, I used my technical knowledge to come up with idea for my marble machine.
        <br>
        My approach was 3d printing every part that was needed to build the maze.The process took a month, including printing and building.
        <p>
        Not knowing how to design 3d models, I was able to find resources that other people invented on Thingiverse and rearrange it to
        fit my needs and design the maze.
        <p>
        <div style="text-align:center">  
        <img src= "img/build.jpg"alt="build"style="width:29%">
        <p><strong>building process</strong></p>
        </div>
        <p>
        Since 3d printing was free on campus, I only had to buy a few dowels, screws, which cost me $7 total. 
        <br>
        Today, the project is displayed at the MakerSpace of the Library and hopefully inspire students to expand their creativity.
