<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>The trivia game was team project created at the 2018 Middle Tennessee State University Hackathon (HackMT).

   in 35 hours and included both hardware and software.

<h4>Challenges and Accomplishment</h4>
<p>
    As exciting and fun the project was, the group encountered many difficulties along the way. 
    <br>
    From learning and adjusting to different tools on the fly, how they function, and managing to create a 
    fully functional project in a few hours; we had to work as a team and not only split tasks but also know
    enough about everything else to help each other when encountering a issue.
