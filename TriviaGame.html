<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>The trivia game was team project created at the 2018 Middle Tennessee State University Hackathon (HackMT). 
    <br>
   The idea was to create a multi-player trivia game with questions about MTSU's campus. The project was completed
   in 35 hours and included both hardware and software. 
</p>

<h4>Tools and Usability</h4>
<p>
The tools and languages used to accomplish the project are:
<ul>
    <li>Python</li>
    <li>Raspberry Pi 3</li>
    <li>Pygame</li>
    <li>Game buttons</li>
</ul>

<p>
The game was built in the Raspberry Pi 3, written in Python using Pygame, a module designed for 
writing video games.
</p>
<p>
    To allow the multi-player feature, we built two game buttons using old boxes, breadboards and red buttons
    and connected them to the Raspberry Pi.

<h4>Challenges and Accomplishment</h4>
<p>
    As exciting and fun the project was, the group encountered many difficulties along the way. 
</p>
<p> 
    From learning and adjusting to different tools on the fly, how they function, and managing to create a 
    fully functional project in a few hours; we had to work as a team and not only split tasks but also know
    enough about everything else to help each other when encountering a issue. 
</p>

<p> By the end of the Hackathon, we were able to show the public our functioning application and have them
    test the game by playing against each other.
